The thefts were discovered in 2016 when the school 
board became suspicious that money was missing and 
a full audit of the accounts was carried out.

Father-of-three Stephen Condon, of The Grange, Raheen, 
Limerick city, admitted stealing €93,000 from St John 
the Baptist National School in Garryowen, in a “spectacular 
breach of trust”, Judge Tom O’Donnell said.
