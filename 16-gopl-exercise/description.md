# Exercise description

The popular web comid _xkcd_ has a JSON interface. For example, a request to
https://xkcd.com/571/info.0.json produces a detailed description of comic 571,
one of my favorites. 

- Download each URL (once!) and build an offline index.
- Write a tool _xkcd_ that, using this index, prints the URL, date and title of each comic whose title or transcript matches a _list of search terms_ provided on the command line.
